Built a high-scale loan default prediction system on 1.3M+ LendingClub records. Includes feature-rich preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model benchmarking, and XGBoost-based deployment. A production-ready Streamlit web app allows real-time borrower risk assessment to support financial decision-making.

## 📌 Objective

To predict whether a borrower will **fully repay** or **default** on a loan, using key financial, credit, and application data. The goal is to reduce loan loss risk by detecting defaulters early and supporting data-backed approval workflows.

---

## 📦 Dataset Summary

- **Source:** LendingClub public dataset  
- **Final Size:** ~1.3M records × 86 features  
- **Target Classes:**  
  - Fully Paid → `0`  
  - Charged Off → `1`  
- Dropped other statuses like "Current", "Late", "In Grace Period"

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

| Feature        | Key Insight                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💰 Loan Amount | Defaults skewed higher (median ₹12L vs ₹9.5L for paid)                      |
| 💳 Income      | Lower-income borrowers showed higher default probability                    |
| 📈 DTI         | DTI > 35% strongly correlated with default                                   |
| 🔎 FICO Score  | FICO < 660 had 4× higher default risk                                        |
| 🛒 Purpose     | Small business/vacation loans showed 3× default rates                        |
| ⏱️ Term        | 60-month loans defaulted 2× more than 36-month terms                        |
| 📉 Interest    | Higher interest rates aligned with higher default likelihood                |

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Removed leakage and ID-like fields (e.g., `recoveries`, `desc`, `member_id`)
- Handled nulls using domain logic (median for `dti`, mode for `term`, etc.)
- Dropped low-signal or high-missing-value columns
- One-hot encoded key categorical features: `purpose`, `home_ownership`, `term`, etc.
- Scaled numeric columns (e.g., `loan_amnt`, `int_rate`, `dti`)
- Used `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost to handle class imbalance (default ~20%)

## 🤖 Model Training & Comparison

Trained and benchmarked three models to maximize recall and F1-score on **default cases (class 1)**.

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | XGBoost ✅ |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 80.1% | 79.7% | 79.7% |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 0.51 | 0.46 | 0.46 |
| **Recall (Class 1)** | 0.07 ❌ | 0.09 ✅ | 0.09 ✅ |
| **F1-Score (Class 1)** | 0.12 | 0.15 ✅ | 0.15 ✅ |
| **True Positives** | 3,782 | 4,637 ✅ | 4,637 ✅ |
| **False Negatives** | 49,930 ❌ | 49,075 ✅ | 49,075 ✅ |

### ✅ Final Model: `XGBoostClassifier`

Reasons:
- Best balance between recall and precision for identifying defaulters
- Fewer false negatives (TP=4,637) → better business risk control
- Tuned with `scale_pos_weight` to handle class imbalance directly
- Scalable, fast, and robust with large datasets (~1.3M records)
